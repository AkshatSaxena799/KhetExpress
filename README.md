# KhetExpress
 DBMS PROJECT
Khet Express: An Agriculture based Management System is an online website that helps buyers 
to shop for their desired Fruits and vegetables sitting comfortably at home along with their 
family. These days people want to explore as many options and are mostly interested in getting 
things delivered at home without them going outside. Buyers would not want to face external 
factors or buy bad products from any vegetable seller, customers rather feel buying fresh 
products online is better than offline. So, this management system works as a boon to both the 
farmer and the customer. The sellers can put up all the available products online along with the 
required details, buyers can make orders, know what they have ordered, etc. On the other side, it 
allows the users to have their own accounts where they can log into or register into the website 
and check the products, add it to the cart, place order, view the cart in order to decide about it 
again, and logout safely when they are done. Khet Express System will make better connection 
among Farmers and Buyers ensure quality food. It will also Standardize and increase efficiency 
of Agro-culture process.
